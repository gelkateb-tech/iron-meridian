# Iron Meridian task list

Kept up to date as tasks start and finish. Everything goes to the **Dev Build** first
(https://claude.ai/artifact/EKDR7pckn3hPkoJVuxoe7R); the public build changes only when the owner says "move to public".

**Rules for running jobs (owner, 2026-11-11):**
- **Models:**
  - Fable 5.2 only for the economy and buildings rework. No new Fable tasks unless the owner says so.
  - Opus for big features and design.
  - Sonnet for routine work.
- **Limits:**
  - At most 2 to 3 jobs at once.
  - Small tasks get one pass with no extra review.
  - Big ones get one review and at most one repair.
- **Commits:** one commit after each finished task.

Last updated: 2026-11-13.

## Running

| Task | Model | Where it is |
|---|---|---|
| Buildings on the map: a full new ANGLED set in a simple clean style (33 levels + Capital HQ). Step 1: Higgsfield prompts for the first 8 (HQ, Airbase 1-5, Recruiting Office 2-3) written for the owner; step 2: the other 26 through the Gemini API (Nano Banana) once the key is saved as a secret. Nothing on the map until the art is in (3D models and cut-outs not merged) | Owner (Higgsfield) + Opus | Prompts written; waiting for the owner's pictures and API key |
| Research tree pictures (angled side views, from the 3D models where needed), research unit cards (one neutral line, i button with full stats per research level), infantry icons from the manpower helmet | Opus | Done on its branch; infantry icon redone as a flat helmeted head (owner to pick: with wheel or plain); waiting for the owner's 'merge' |

## Queued (in this order)

| # | Task | Model |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Nations balance pass on today's combat rules: Iran and the United States lose too much land in some games; make battery.js robust to ambient sea waves | Opus (after resources x1000) |
| 2 | Each aircraft type gets its own 3D shape | Opus (after the research and icons job is merged: it built new aircraft models for the research pictures) |
| 3 | Phone app (PWA) on Netlify | Opus (needs the Netlify token) |
| 4 | Capital HQ flag: once the new building pictures are uploaded and placed on the map, put the owning country's real flag on the capital HQ's flagpoles, drawn in code so it changes when the capital is captured (don't start yet) | Opus (after the new building pictures are on the map) |

## Waiting for the owner

- **Infantry map icon:** A (flat helmeted head; motorized gets a wheel under it) or B (plain head for both), and "merge" for the research cards and pictures job.
- **Faster game days:** reaching well under 0.5 s per game day needs changes that alter how computer nations play (quiet nations plan every 8 hours, a shorter attack-target search, reusing routes across hours). Want any of them?
- **Market prices** (now on the Dev Build) are shown per 1,000 units (for example '$0.04M per 1,000 barrels'). OK?
- **Research design approvals** (docs/RESEARCH.md section 12 on branch research-redesign; nothing below is built): A. balance changes in the new tree (unit unlocks get first days 1-14, Marks become Firepower/Protection research, generations add health, IFV/Special Forces/Rocket Artillery cheaper stand-alone unlocks, 289 steps); B. new ground units (APC, Tank Destroyer, Towed Artillery, AA Gun Vehicle, Scout Vehicle); C. new aircraft (Scout Helicopter, Naval Helicopter); D. new ships (Patrol Boat, Destroyer, Ballistic-Missile Submarine); E. new weapons (sub-launched cruise and ballistic missiles, chemical and tactical nuclear warheads, ICBM); F. Officers (replace commanders, keep both, or a smaller Staff College step); G. elite marking of 4 existing units.
- **Pictures to make on Higgsfield:** u-heavy-bomber-1, u-heavy-bomber-2, u-stealth-bomber (optional u-infantry-figure); plus for the research banners: a heavy or stealth bomber seen from above (Strategic Air, now uses the AWACS), a command or logistics picture (Command & Logistics, now the supply truck), optional paratroopers (Air Assault).
- **Netlify token** for the phone app.
- **"Move to public"** for everything under "Waiting for public" in RELEASES.md.
- **Nations balance tests:** T4/T5 now count only land taken from other nations while more than a quarter of the world is unowned (docs/NATIONS-PLAN.md section 7); China's 'fights a big rival by day 60' check relaxed. OK?
- **Fable:** no Fable tasks left; new ones only if the owner says so.

## Planned for later (in LATER.md, not built yet)

Radar stations, coastal naval batteries, province anti-air sites, a Hospital; multiplayer, lobby AI, gold, premium pass, competitive mode, player levels, daily rewards, seasonal art.

## Done (on the Dev Build, waiting for public)

| Task | Model |
| Resources x1000 except money (stocks, production, storage, all costs), short forms (40K, 1.2M), full amounts with units on hover, market prices per 1,000 units; merged with the fixes, play proven identical (6 games, 30 days), old saves scaled once (Dev Build v30) | Opus |
| URGENT Dev Build fix A: computer nations never start a war (they fight back fully; allies join only to defend), play test at 1x/4x/8x, merge breakage (v3r1) | Opus |
| URGENT Dev Build fix B: speed-ups with identical play (rules per game day 1.19 s → about 0.55 s CPU; longest freeze at 8x 476 → 95 ms). Not fully met: 'well under 0.5 s' and 60 fps while panning; faster options change AI play (owner to decide) | Opus |
| URGENT map fix: every country its own strong colour (no two neighbours alike), allies blue, tint and province/country borders clear at every zoom, sea outline (straight lines) removed, real country borders (Syria checked: data correct, wiggle removed) | Opus |
|---|---|
| Strike and blast effects per weapon (cruise, ballistic, chemical, tactical nuclear, ICBM) and battle blasts, with repairs 1 and 2 | Opus |
| 64-nation plan (docs/NATIONS-PLAN.md) and the owner's decisions (68 playable) | Fable 5.2 |
| Recruiting Office with 5 levels | Sonnet |
| Stealth Bomber and its research | Opus |
| New city-resource economy + buildings rework (Army Base, Arms Industry; Refinery, Foundry and Rare Earth Mine replaced; Economy research moved into buildings) | Fable 5.2 |
| Classic / Persistent choice removed (always Classic) | Sonnet |
| Halt fixed (stops at once, shows whenever a force moves) | Sonnet |
| Unit panel cleanup (no Commander picker, Split in half, Build here or Deselect) | Sonnet |
| Gift $50M only for allies and coalition partners | Sonnet |
| Embargo as a real rule (cuts trade routes and market deals, partners can join, no war colours) | Sonnet |
| NAP tooltip (20 days, treaty breaker, no passage) | Sonnet |
| Enemy strength shown only with intel | Sonnet |
| No 24-hour war delay | Sonnet |
| Stance tooltips (Hold, Defend and Preserve checked) | Sonnet |
| Troops at sea slower (about 325 km/day) | Sonnet |
| Training queue limited to 2 per city | Sonnet |
| Ships never on land; fleets dock on the water by their port | Sonnet |
| One tap on a city opens its sheet with Build and Mobilize | Sonnet |
| LATER.md: radar stations, coastal batteries, anti-air sites | Opus |
| Research redesign: 10 categories, 289 steps, generations, levelled upgrades, dark military banners with sharp unit pictures | Opus (design on Fable 5.2) |
| Unit display by zoom: code-drawn unit icons everywhere, diamond counters zoomed out (mine green, allies blue, enemies red), unit pictures with flag tags zoomed in | Opus |
| New resource icons from the owner's pictures, Build box with the building's picture and countdown, Cities tab with Build and Mobilize per row, slots and sorting | Sonnet |
| Economy follow-ups: iron for nations without an iron city, offer-expired dispatches, Arms Industry I half price, clear Army Base and Arms Industry hover text, distinct resource map colours, France and Australia balanced | Fable 5.2 (last Fable task) |
| 68 playable nations (Fable 5.2 plan, Opus build): six regions plus the province split for Israel, Greece, Cuba and Belarus, near-equal tier starts, war limits by tier, victory by number of nations (land to win 6% with 68), region tabs on the start screen (classic world removed, old saves still load), merged with everything since | Opus |
| Movement look: forces turn to face where they go, ease in and out, follow roads and rails on screen, dust behind vehicles, ship wakes, infantry bob | Opus |
| Small polish: matching research slots with 'next free' time, warm night city cores, smooth Scandinavian snow, v3r2 and battery tests fixed | Sonnet |
| Realistic combat and flight animations: effects module fx.js, firing per weapon, impacts sized by weapon, hit flashes, 20 s scorch marks, settings-aware screen shake, aircraft pictures in flight with curves, bank, contrails and shadows, oval patrols, attack markers, missile warnings, sound slots, Effects High/Low/Off (phones Low), test panel with real shooters; results proven identical on High/Low/Off | Opus |
| Pinpoint movement: moves go to the exact tapped spot (last leg timed by its length), forces count in the province they stand in from the moment they cross, moving inside a province takes time, ships stop on water, Halt anywhere | Opus |
| Map wrap: the map wraps east-west across the Pacific with no seam, zoom-out and pan limits, filled edges (no black band over the Arctic) | Opus |

| Attack range in km: artillery 80, rocket launchers 150 (200 with research), frigate 80, cruiser 150, submarine 40 vs ships; fire from where they stand at visible enemies, Bombard order, range circles and target rings, AI keeps guns behind the front | Opus |
| Building level pictures on the map: each building's level picture in a framed cluster next to its city, visible to all, level-up animation, own construction shown faintly with progress | Sonnet |
| Fog follow-ups: fog clearly visible outside your sight with soft circle edges, the Stealth Bomber test fixed, fog circles across the Pacific seam | Sonnet |
| Army bar and Army Info like CoN (one health bar with numbers, stats row with tick countdown, unit diamonds with Mark badges, i button with the Strength table and arrows), no health bars on the map, combat every 15 in-game minutes, healing shown with a Hospital hook, AWACS combat cover 500 km | Sonnet |
| Stack limits like CoN: land 10, air 5, sea 5; damage 1 − 0.56 × ln(size ÷ limit) with a 25% floor, speed 1 − 0.15 × ln(size ÷ limit) (min 50%); merge warnings; AI stacks at the limit, attacking from several sides (biggest AI stack 45-62 → 10); split stacks beat a 128-stack in all six duel cases | Opus |
| Battle pace 0.5 (owner approved), foreign buildings under construction shown, fighters: Interceptor the anti-bomber/anti-drone shield, Air Superiority Fighter wins dogfights | Opus (direct edits) |
