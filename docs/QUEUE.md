# Iron Meridian task list

Kept up to date as tasks start and finish. Everything goes to the **Dev Build** first
(https://claude.ai/artifact/EKDR7pckn3hPkoJVuxoe7R); the public build changes only when the owner says "move to public".

**Rules for running jobs (owner, 2026-11-11):**
- **Models:**
  - Fable 5.2 only for the economy and buildings rework. No new Fable tasks unless the owner says so.
  - Opus for big features and design.
  - Sonnet for routine work.
- **Limits:**
  - At most 2 to 3 jobs at once.
  - Small tasks get one pass with no extra review.
  - Big ones get one review and at most one repair.
- **Commits:** one commit after each finished task.

Last updated: 2026-11-11.

## Running

| Task | Model | Where it is |
|---|---|---|
| 68 playable nations, region by region (plumbing, province split for Israel, Greece, Cuba and Belarus, then Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Americas, Oceania) | Opus | Province split step done, regions next |
| Realistic combat and flight animations (effects module, firing per unit type, impacts, aircraft flight, markers and warnings, sound slots, Effects High/Low/Off, test panel, proof results are identical) | Opus | Started |
| Building pictures fix: cut-out buildings without frames, small and right at their city, grouped tightly (one at mid zoom, none zoomed out), small level dots; capital building anchored on the capital and restyled; zoom drift checked | Opus | Done on its branch; waiting for the owner's OK on the screenshots before merging |
| Research tree pictures (angled side views, from the 3D models where needed), research unit cards (one neutral line, i button with full stats per research level), infantry icons from the manpower helmet | Opus | Done on its branch; waiting for the owner's OK on the screenshots before merging |

## Queued (in this order)

| # | Task | Model |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Resources x1000 except money (stocks, production, storage, all costs), short forms (40K, 1.2M), hover shows the full amount with a unit (40,000 barrels of oil); before/after examples | Opus (after the 68 nations are merged, since both touch every number) |
| 2 | Pinpoint movement for land units and ships (move to the exact spot; Halt for ships) | Opus |
| 3 | Movement look: units turn to face where they go, dust, wakes, contrails, follow roads on screen | Opus |
| 4 | Each aircraft type gets its own 3D shape | Opus |
| 5 | Small polish: research slot colours and "Both slots busy" time, night city cores, Sweden snow edge, Berlin garrison placement | Sonnet |
| 6 | Phone app (PWA) on Netlify | Opus (needs the Netlify token) |

## Waiting for the owner

- **Battle pace** (docs/COMBAT-PACE.md): measured, even fights already last 14-21 h (small) and 31-40 h (big); the quick ones are lopsided (3:1 over in 7-12 h). Proposal: BATTLE_PACE = 0.5 (one line; 3:1 on 10 units 7 → 12 h, 100v50 13 → 22 h, even 100v100 31 → 46 h; about 10% fewer losses a day). Approve 0.5, 0.35, or keep 1?
- **Battle balance bar:** the army bar job removed the red/green balance bar over battles on the map along with the health bars (the crossed swords and red edge stay). Keep it removed?
- **Research design approvals** (docs/RESEARCH.md section 12 on branch research-redesign; nothing below is built): A. balance changes in the new tree (unit unlocks get first days 1-14, Marks become Firepower/Protection research, generations add health, IFV/Special Forces/Rocket Artillery cheaper stand-alone unlocks, 289 steps); B. new ground units (APC, Tank Destroyer, Towed Artillery, AA Gun Vehicle, Scout Vehicle); C. new aircraft (Scout Helicopter, Naval Helicopter); D. new ships (Patrol Boat, Destroyer, Ballistic-Missile Submarine); E. new weapons (sub-launched cruise and ballistic missiles, chemical and tactical nuclear warheads, ICBM); F. Officers (replace commanders, keep both, or a smaller Staff College step); G. elite marking of 4 existing units.
- **Infantry art:** the code-drawn infantry icon is a helmet (a motorized version exists); close in, infantry squads still need a u-infantry-figure picture.
- **Pictures to make on Higgsfield:** u-heavy-bomber-1, u-heavy-bomber-2, u-stealth-bomber (optional u-infantry-figure); plus for the research banners: a heavy or stealth bomber seen from above (Strategic Air, now uses the AWACS), a command or logistics picture (Command & Logistics, now the supply truck), optional paratroopers (Air Assault).
- **Netlify token** for the phone app.
- **"Move to public"** for everything under "Waiting for public" in RELEASES.md.
- **Resource-bar button:** the storage case went on the button at the left of the resource bar, which opens the missile stocks (there is no separate all-resources list). Keep it, or add an all-resources list there?
- **Building pictures size:** at play zoom the clusters are fairly big and can sit a little away from their city (e.g. Hamburg's below it toward Hanover). Smaller tiles, or fewer at play zoom?
- **Fog decision:** a foreign country's building under construction is hidden (finished buildings show for everyone); show it too?
- **Fable:** no Fable tasks left; new ones only if the owner says so.

## Planned for later (in LATER.md, not built yet)

Radar stations, coastal naval batteries, province anti-air sites, a Hospital; multiplayer, lobby AI, gold, premium pass, competitive mode, player levels, daily rewards, seasonal art.
